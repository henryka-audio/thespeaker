## Printing guide
I printed these components out of PETG-CF: 3 walls,	30% gyroid infill, layer height 0.2mm.

        Main shell:
            •	 I printed it laying on speaker(front) side, with strong supports;

        Back:
            •	Printed on back side, no supports;

        Front:
            •	Print two holder sides flat;
            •	Every one of 12 ribs print  flat on bed;

        Finger Loop aka Holder:
            •	No supports, printed verticaly with variable layer height set to quality;

        Logo:
            •	Printed with supports, from back, that front facing surfaces will have nice finish;

        18650 holder:
            •	Printed upside down, with supports, screw, screw holes 😊 

## TPU Prints

In STL directory you will find gaskets and stand as well, those were printed out of TPU 98A. 
Even though I included all designed gaskets, you can get away with printing only stand.
From tests I’ve observed that enclousure holds up pressure without any gasket.

Said that, I still do reccomend printing at least back side gasket.

## Assembly guide:

Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any fire hazard that may occurr due to wrong handling of Li-Ion batteries.

Start with soldering iron and placing brass inserts in holes as shown in pictures.

Becarefull, passive radiators does not require any insert, frame HAVE threads.

Assuming that you already put inserts, now you can test fit components.

Therefore continue with soldering cables as shown in diagram.
