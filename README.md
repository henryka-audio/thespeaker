# Henryka The Speaker

Welcome to the project of an open 3D-printable portable Bluetooth speaker. Hope you will have fun building your own.

Soon your favourite Bluetooth speaker.

## Tools List

* Hex screwdriver: 1.5 mm, 2.5 mm
* Soldering iron
* Cable cutter
* Glue
* Hot glue gun
* Zip ties
* Self-adhesive thin foam (can be double-sided spongy tape as well)

## Parts List

**Amplifier with Bluetooth:**

* Mini Ultra HD I2S TAS5805 Bluetooth DSP Amplifier Board 2.0/1.1 Channel 60 W
* For this amplifier you need a cooling radiator 2 × 2 × 1 cm

**BMS:**

* 5S Li-ion Lithium Battery 18650 Charger BMS

**Charging:**

* PD3.1 IP2369 45 W PD Fast Charging 2S-6S Li-ion/LiFePO4 Lithium Battery Charger/Discharger

**Power:**

* 5× 18650 Li-Ion batteries
* 18650 spring-loaded connectors [11.28 × 11.5 mm]
* Missile-style switch KN3A-101 toggle switch, rocker arm, 2-pin, 2-gear ON-OFF, 10 A 125 V/250 V AC, cap matching 12 V, 24 V, 48 V, 110 V, 220 V universal

**Subwoofer speaker:**

* AIYIMA Audio 3-inch portable subwoofer speaker, 60 W power, 4 Ohm

**Tweeter speaker:**

* 52 mm round audio speaker, 4 Ohm, 10 W tweeter, silk membrane

**Passive radiator speaker:**

* 120 mm × 49 mm rectangular subwoofer diaphragm guide with frame

**Screws:**

* 11 × M2×8
* 40 × M3×6

**Brass inserts:**

* 11 × M2 – outer diameter 4 mm
* 40 × M3 – outer diameter 5 mm

**Cables:**

* 2 m × 0.5 mm OFC
* 2 m × 0.2 mm OFC single core

## Printing Guide

I printed these components out of PETG-CF: 3 walls, 30 % gyroid infill, layer height 0.2 mm.

**Main shell:**

* Printed laying on the speaker (front) side, with strong supports

**Back:**

* Printed on the back side, no supports

**Front:**

* Print two holder sides flat
* Each of the 12 ribs printed flat on the bed

**Finger loop (aka holder):**

* No supports, printed vertically with variable layer height set to quality

**Logo:**

* Printed with supports, from the back, so that front-facing surfaces have a nice finish

**18650 holder:**

* Printed upside down, with supports, screw and screw holes 😊

## TPU Prints

In the STL directory you will find gaskets and a stand as well; those were printed out of TPU 98A.
Even though I included all designed gaskets, you can get away with printing only the stand.
From tests I’ve observed that the enclosure holds up pressure without any gasket.

That said, I still do recommend printing at least the back-side gasket.

## Assembly Guide

**Disclaimer:** I am not responsible for any fire hazard that may occur due to wrong handling of Li-ion batteries.

Start with the soldering iron and placing brass inserts in holes as shown in the pictures.

Be careful: passive radiators do not require any inserts; the frame has threads.

Assuming that you already put the inserts in, you can now test-fit components.

Then continue with soldering cables as shown in the diagram.

## DSP Tuning

For DSP tuning you need proprietary software called ACPWorkbench; ask the seller of the amplifier for it.

I would advise you to run it in a virtual machine environment.
